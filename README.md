free-loops
==========

Practical summary: Fast, imperative-style loops as a free monad EDSL.

Academic summary: Loops have the structure of a monad. Bind (`>>=`) nests loops
and `return x` is a loop with a single iteration over a value `x`.

A silly example
---------------

At first, the statement that "bind nests loops" may seem strange, but can be
motivated by the `Monad` instance for lists. Consider the following
`do`-notation for a list:

~~~ {.haskell}
module Example where

import Control.Loop
import Data.Foldable (foldr)
import Prelude hiding (foldr)

-- A list of pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i <= 3 and 0 <= j <= i
nestedList :: [(Int, Int)]
nestedList = do
    i <- [0..3]
    j <- [0..i]
    return (i, j)
~~~

If you're not familiar with this use of lists, load up this file in ghci
with `ghci -isrc -pgmL markdown-unlit README.lhs`. (You need to have
[markdown-unlit](https://github.com/sol/markdown-unlit) installed first.)
Enter `nestedList` at the prompt and see:

~~~
>>> nestedList
[(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)]
~~~

Now let's do something really silly: let's build the same list with a
`Loop`!

~~~ {.haskell}
nestedList' :: [(Int, Int)]
nestedList' = foldr (:) [] $ do
    -- explicit type signature disambiguates between the many Foldable types
    i <- for 0 (<= 3) (+ 1) :: Loop Int
    j <- for 0 (<= i) (+ 1)
    return (i, j)
~~~

You would never actually want to do this. This example is simply to
illustrate what "bind nests loops" means in a context most Haskellers are
familiar with.

The correspondence between the list monad and the loop monad is not a
coincidence! GHC uses stream fusion to reduce (some) uses of lists to simple
loops so that the evaluated list is never held in memory. Unfortunately,
using lists as loops is dangerous in performance-sensitive code because the
fusion rules may fail to fire, leaving you with a fully-evaluated list on
the heap! Libraries that rely on fusion require extensive use of inlining,
which increases compile time and memory usage dramatically.  These are the
limitations that inspired me to write this library. A `Loop` can only
evaluate one iteration at a time, so there is no larger data structure that
needs to be fused. Consequently, performance is less fragile.

You might complain that this style of programming does not fit Haskell very
well, but I would contend just the opposite. As I mentioned above, lists are the
more general case of loops: a list can be just a plain loop (fused), or it can
be all the iterations of the loop held in memory at once.  In fact, lists admit
some operations (like `reverse`) that prevent fusion, but `Loop` has a refined
type that only allows construction of fusible operations!  This is exactly where
Haskell shines: the type system prevents incorrect (or in this case,
undesirable) programs from being written. I see this as part of a (relatively
recent) trend in Haskell toward using the type system to guarantee performance
in addition to correctness.
